I saw some strange index which somebody had done saying these are countries press freedom in countries okay I think

I was amazed at number you know I thought we had the most uncontrollable press and I mean somebody is getting something

fundamentally wrong uh so I found I don't know Afghanistan was Freer than us, I mean Afghanistan can you imagine I mean where 

they actually, so, look these are all I mean I see a democracy index Freedom index religious freedom and express Freedom index 

these are all ways of playing mind games of you know elevating somebody you like doing down somebody you don't like I think we 

have to absorb it we have to combat it I agree with you we need to counter it
