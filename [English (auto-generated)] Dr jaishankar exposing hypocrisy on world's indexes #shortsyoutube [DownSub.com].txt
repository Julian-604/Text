## We have not yet passed laws of Sanctions on

To be very honest if there's one thing which baffles me about American thinking currently and to some extent European thinking 
it is the obsession with Russia you know I think it's it's so emotional uh it's so this is Pakistan you know in a way we haven't yet passed laws of sanctions against [] in our own part of the world we get advice from other people saying you know be practical to be rational you can't not talk to the other guy okay they may be doing bad things but you've got to live with it you've got to get them into that then now you know for eign and I'm not sure it's even smart
